Docker was not the inventor of containers, but it made them easier to use with the three steps to creating and running them:

1.  Images: It aids you in packaging an application (with all its dependencies).
2.  Registries: It helps to distribute that app around to all the places you need to run it.
3.  Containers: It runs that app in a highly reproducible way.
